/**
  * Implements a data-agnostic persistent event store, in the Event Sourcing
  * methodology. The store is divided into scopes, and within each scope events
  * can be admitted to a log, one at a time. Clients request events to be
  * admitted to the log by sending [[StoreIfValid]] messages containing the
  * prospective [[EventType]].
  *
  * The sender of the event will receive a [[ValidationRequest]] message, and
  * is then responsible for validating the event, or delegating that
  * responsibility. The validator determines whether a command should be
  * accepted as an event, considering all of the previously accepted events as
  * context for that decision, and replies to the log with a
  * [[ValidationResponse]] message. The log will then persist the event to
  * storage, if it was accepted, and then reply to the client with a [[Result]]
  * message. The client is then responsible for carrying out the consequences
  * of the event being accepted or rejected, e.g. updating state and notifying
  * its downstream clients. During validation, the AtomicEventStore postpones
  * consideration of any other events, maintaining atomicity.
  *
  * It's important for the client to *not* attempt to perform any
  * "prevalidation" on an event in the context of other events, before sending
  * the event to the AtomicEventStore. This would break atomicity. Always do
  * all validation only in response to the [[ValidationRequest]] message.
  *
  * Subclass this abstract class, and then use
  * [[AtomicEventStore#receptionistProps]] as the entry point for instantiating
  * the system. The receptionist manages the lifecycle of the logs, and the
  * logs manage their own persistence.
  *
  * @tparam EventType the supertype of domain events used by this store
  * @tparam ValidationReason supertype for descriptor objects that indicate why
  *                          an event validation failed (or succeeded)
