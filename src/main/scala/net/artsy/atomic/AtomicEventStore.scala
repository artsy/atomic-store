/**
 * Implements a data-agnostic persistent event store, in the Event Sourcing
 * methodology. The store is divided into scopes, and within each scope events
 * can be admitted to a log, one at a time. Clients request events to be
 * admitted to the log by sending [[StoreIfValid]] messages containing the
 * prospective EventType.
 *
 * The sender of the event will receive a [[ValidationRequest]] message, and
 * is then responsible for validating the event, or delegating that
 * responsibility. The validator determines whether a command should be
 * accepted as an event, considering all of the previously accepted events as
 * context for that decision, and replies to the log with a
 * [[ValidationResponse]] message. The log will then persist the event to
 * storage, if it was accepted, and then reply to the client with a [[Result]]
 * message. The client is then responsible for carrying out the consequences
 * of the event being accepted or rejected, e.g. updating state and notifying
 * its downstream clients. During validation, the AtomicEventStore postpones
 * consideration of any other events, maintaining atomicity.
 *
 * It's important for the client to *not* attempt to perform any
 * "prevalidation" on an event in the context of other events, before sending
 * the event to the AtomicEventStore. This would break atomicity. Always do
 * all validation only in response to the [[ValidationRequest]] message.
 *
 * Subclass this abstract class, and then use
 * [[AtomicEventStore#receptionistProps]] as the entry point for instantiating
 * the system. The receptionist manages the lifecycle of the logs, and the
 * logs manage their own persistence.
 *
 * @tparam EventType the supertype of domain events used by this store
 * @tparam ValidationReason supertype for descriptor objects that indicate why
 *                          an event validation failed (or succeeded).
 * @param timeoutReason reason object for validations that timeout.
